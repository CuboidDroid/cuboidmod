# CuboidDroid's Support Mod

CuboidDroid's support mod for the Cuboid Outpost modpack.

This mod is currently not meant to be used directly and is 
currently heavily biased towards the needs of the Cuboid Outpost
modpack.

If there is enough interest, this may change in future to allow 
for wider usage in other modpacks too (by adding things like more
configuration options, etc.)

For now though, it's best to just consider this as a requirement 
mod for Cuboid Outpost, which you should can find on CurseForge
here:
